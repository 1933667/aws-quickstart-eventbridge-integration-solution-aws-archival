## Amazon EventBridge Integration Solution for Data Archival

This Quick Start demonstrates an integration with Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose and Amazon S3 for Amazon EventBridge SaaS Partner Integrations. This solution enables your Amazon EventBridge event bus to trigger a rule that evaluates all events and puts records on an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream as a target for matched events and delivers them to an Amazon S3 bucket. You can use this as a starter project to extend this solution for any scenario that can use Kinesis Data Firehose to transform and deliver data to various destinations.
